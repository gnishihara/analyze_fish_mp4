# Analyze mp4 data for fish

* ffmpeg
* imagemagick
* R (tidyverse, magick, ggpubr, furrr)

I am not sure if this will work in windows or osx, since it was developed on Debian.

* Scripts must be run in sequence
* Examine `main_script.sh` and `remove_background.sh` for details.
* Scripts are not necessarily independent.
